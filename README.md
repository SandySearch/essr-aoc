Emergency Services Search and Report for the Agents of Change Hackathon, 11 &amp; 12 August 2018 in NYC

## Idea

I was in Super Storm Sandy in Connecticut was was without power for 9 days.
During the disaster, we had a very hard time discovering what services were available and when and where.

The idea for this service is to use the power of crowdsourcing (think "Waze for Services, after a disaster").  It currently allows anyone (without a login) to search and report on services available.

Verified users (pre-registered, think Red Cross, National Guard, and business owners/managers) can leave "verified" status updates, at no cost.

I think the service could be used as a branding expense to get good press and more prospective customers.  The majority of the expense would be the manual verification of "verified" users.

## Things left to do:

- iOS build - just need my Mac.
- complete the backend debugging with Google Firebase (currently on a free spark plan).
- add in the real distance calculations (from stree address).  There are seveal free services for this but they may be rate limited.
- add a map view (with Google Maps or OpenStreetMaps)
- add the account request function (and screen) - something like Goole Forms would work well.

## Demos

The code is currently hosted on Firebase as a demo at:
